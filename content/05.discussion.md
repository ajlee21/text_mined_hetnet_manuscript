## Discussion

We tested the feasibility of re-using label functions to extract relationships from literature.
Through our sampling experiment, we found that adding edge-specific label functions increases performance for the generative model ({@fig:auroc_gen_model_performance}.
We found that label functions designed from relatively related edge types can increase performance (seen when Gene interacts Gene (GiG) label functions predicts Compound binds Gene (CbG) and vice versa), while one edge type (Disease associates Gene (DaG)) remained agnostic to label function source (Figure {@fig:auroc_gen_model_performance} and Supplemental Figure {@fig:aupr_gen_model_performance}).
Plus, we found that using label functions all at once generally hurts performance with the exception for DaG (Figure {@fig:auroc_grabbag_gen_model_test_set} and Supplemental Figure {@fig:aupr_grabbag_gen_model_test_set}).
Reason for this is that DaG is a broad edge type that can contain linguistic features for other edge types such as Disease (up/down)regulating a gene (Figure {@fig:hetionet}).  

Regarding the discriminator model, adding edge-specifc label function immensely improved performance for two out of the four edge types (Compound treats Disease (CtD) and DaG) ({@fig:auroc_disc_model_performance}). 
Discrimintator models for GiG and CbG showed minor improvements over the generative model, but only when all edge-specific label functions are included.
Potential cause for poor performance is the negative class bias for some of our datasets (Table {@tbl:candidate-sentences}).
Plus, the GiG dataset contains a prodigious amount of spurious gene mentions, because Pubtator [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkt441] tags gene abbrevations along with gene symbols.
Despite discriminator model's performance, we encounted difficulty in calibrating each model (Figure {@fig:discriminative_model_calibration}).
The temperature scaling algorithm is able to calibrate the high scores for each model, but could fully calibrate each model. 
A possible reason for poor calibration is that our labeled datasets are too small (Table {@tbl:candidate-sentences}) and calibration could improve with more examples.
We recalled a great number of existing edges in Hetionet v1 edges as well as detect over thousands of new edges to each edge type (Figure {@fig:hetionet_reconstruction}).
Overall, our findings highlight that this framework can effeciently extract relationships and show that it can establish edges within Hetionet v1.
