## Discussion

We measured the extent to which label functions can be re-used across multiple edge types to extract relationships from literature.
Through our sampling experiment, we found that adding edge-specific label functions increases performance for the generative model (Figure {@fig:auroc_gen_model_test_set}).
We found that label functions designed from relatively related edge types can increase performance (Gene interacts Gene (GiG) label functions predicting the Compound binds Gene (CbG) edge and vice versa), while the Disease associates Gene (DaG) edge type remained agnostic to label function sources (Figure {@fig:auroc_gen_model_test_set} and Supplemental Figure {@fig:aupr_gen_model_test_set}).
Furthermore, we found that using all label functions at once generally hurts performance with the exception being the DaG edge type (Figure {@fig:auroc_grabbag_gen_model_test_set} and Supplemental Figure {@fig:aupr_grabbag_gen_model_test_set}).
One possibility for this observation is that DaG is a broadly defined edge type.
For example, DaG may contain many concepts related to other edge types such as Disease (up/down) regulating a Gene, which makes it more agnostic to label function sources (examples highlighted in our [annotated sentences](https://github.com/greenelab/text_mined_hetnet_manuscript/tree/master/supplementary_materials/annotated_sentences)).  

Regarding the discriminative model, adding edge-specific label function substantially improved performance for two out of the four edge types (Compound treats Disease (CtD) and  Disease associates Gene (DaG)) (Figure {@fig:auroc_discriminative_model_performance} and Supplemental Figure {@fig:aupr_discriminative_model_performance}). 
Gene interacts Gene (GiG) and Compound binds Gene (CbG) discriminative models showed minor improvements compared to the generative model, but only when nearly all edge-specific label functions are included (Figure {@fig:auroc_discriminative_model_performance} and Supplemental Figure {@fig:aupr_discriminative_model_performance}).
We came across a large amount of spurious gene mentions when working with the discriminative model and believe that these mentions contributed to CbG and GiG's hindered performance.
We encountered difficulty in calibrating each discriminative model (Supplemental Figure {@fig:discriminative_model_calibration}).
The temperature scaling algorithm appears to improve calibration for the highest scores for each model but did not successfully calibrate throughout the entire range of predictions. 
Improving performance for all predictions may require more labeled examples or may be a limitation of the approach in this setting.
Even with these limitations, this early-stage approach could recall many existing edges from an existing knowledge base, Hetionet v1, and suggest many new high-confidence edges for inclusion (Supplemental Figure {@fig:hetionet_reconstruction}).
Our findings suggest that further work, including an expansion of edge types and a move to full text from abstracts, may make this approach suitable for building continuously updated knowledge bases to address drug repositioning and other biomedical challenges.
