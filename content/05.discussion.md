## Discussion

We tested the feasibility of re-using label functions to extract relationships from literature.
Through our sampling experiment we found that adding relevant label functions increases prediction performance (shown in the on-diagonals of Figures {@fig:generative_model_auroc} and {@fig:generative_model_auprc}).
We found that label functions designed from relatively related edge types can increase performance (seen when GiG label functions predicts CbG and vise versa).
We noticed that one edge type (DaG) is agnostic to label function source (Figures {@fig:generative_model_auroc} and {@fig:generative_model_auprc}). 
Performance increases when adding a single label function to our baseline model (the generative model trained only on distant superivison label functions).
Initially we thought that adding a small amount of noise aided the model, but this turns out to not be the case (Figure {@fig:random_label_function_auroc} and {@fig:random_label_function_auprc}).
This result begs the question: why does performance drastically increase when adding a single label function to our distant supervision baseline?

The discriminative model didn't work as intended. 
Majority of the time the discriminative model underperformed the generative model (Figures {@fig:discriminative_model_auroc} and {@fig:discriminative_model_auprc}).
Potential reasons for this are the discriminative model overfitting to the generative model's predictions and there is a negative class bias in some of our datasets (Table {@tbl:candidate-sentences}).
These two pitfalls are a big reason for problems we encountered in our downstream analyses (discriminative model calibration (Figure {@fig:discriminative_model_calibration}) and poor recall in detecting existing edges in Hetionet v1 (Figure {@fig:hetionet_reconstruction})).
Despite the above complications, our model had similar performance with a published baseline model (Figure {@fig:cocoscore_comparison}).
This implies that with better tuning the discriminative model has the potential to perform better than the baseline model.
