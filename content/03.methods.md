#Materials and Methods

##Dataset
Talk about dataset - Pubtator
Talk about preprocessing Pubtator
Talk about hand annotations for each realtion

## Label Functions
describe what a label function is and how many we created for each relation

## Training Models
### Generative Model
talk about generative model and how it works
### Word Embeddings
mention facebooks fasttext model and how we used it to train word vectors
### Discriminator Model
The discriminator model for this project is a piecewise convolutional neural network [@doi:10.18653/v1/D15-1203]. 
This network consists of using multiple kernel filters to essentialy create a trigram model to predict sentences. 
We used three different kernels of size 7 for the convolutional layer. 
The next layer we used is a fully connected layer that with 300 neurons for the first layer, 100 for the second layer and 50 for the last layer.
