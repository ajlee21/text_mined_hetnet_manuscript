### Generative Model
The generative model is the core part of this automatic annotation framework.
This model incorporates the multiple signals emitted by label functions and assigns the most appropriate training class to each candidate sentence.
The model assigns training classes by estimating the joint probability distribution of the latent true class and label function signals, $P(\Lambda, Y)$.
Assuming each label function is conditionally independent, the joint distribution is defined as follows:  

$$
P(\Lambda, Y) = \frac{\exp(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \theta^{T}F_{i}(\Lambda, y))}
{\sum_{\Lambda'}\sum_{y'} \exp(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \theta^{T}F_{i}(\Lambda', y'))}
$$  

where $m$ is the number of candidate sentences, $\Lambda$ is the individual label function, $y$ is the class label, $F$ is the vector of summary statistics and $\theta$ is a vector of weights for each statistic.
The summary statistics used by this model are as follows:  

$$F^{Lab}_{i,j}(\Lambda, Y) = \unicode{x1D7D9}\{\Lambda_{i,j} \neq 0\}$$
$$F^{Acc}_{i,j}(\Lambda, Y) = \unicode{x1D7D9}\{\Lambda_{i,j} = y_{i,j}\}$$   

Where *Lab* stands for the label function propensity, which is the likelihood of a label function emitting a signal.
*Acc* is the individual label function's accuracy given the training class.
This model finds the opimial weights ($\theta$) by minimizing the negative log likelihood:

$$\hat{\theta} = argmin_{\theta} -\sum_{\Lambda} log \sum_{Y}P(\Lambda, Y)$$

Once optimized, the predictions from the generative model, $\hat{Y} = P(Y \mid \Lambda)$, are used as training classes for our dataset [@doi:10.1145/3209889.3209898; @doi:10.14778/3157794.3157797].
