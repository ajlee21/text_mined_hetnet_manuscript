## Label Functions for Annotating Sentences
To incorporate weak signals domain experts would  create simple pythonic functions called label functions.
These functions are designed to emit: a positive label (1), a negative label (-1) 
or an abstain label (0).
Our label functions are broken down into three categories (Databases, Text Patterns and Domain Heuristics).

*Databases*: This category of label functions are designed to use databases such as GWAS catalog or DISEASES to determine if a mention pair has been previously established before.

*Text Patterns*: This category of label functions are designed to provide sentence contextual information such as keywords, number of words between two mentions and rules on gramatical structure of a sentence.

*Domain Heuristics*: This category of label functions is designed to incorporate domain expert knowledge and heuristic rules to annotation sentences.

Through threse different categories we can weakly label all candidate sentences.
After labeling each sentence we trained a model that incorporates these weak signals to estimate the most probable training label for each candidate.
