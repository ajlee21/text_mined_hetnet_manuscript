#Materials and Methods

##Dataset
Talk about dataset - Pubtator
Talk about preprocessing Pubtator
Talk about hand annotations for each realtion

## Label Functions
describe what a label function is and how many we created for each relation

## Training Models
### Generative Model
talk about generative model and how it works
### Word Embeddings
mention facebooks fasttext model and how we used it to train word vectors
### Discriminator Model
talk about the discriminator model and how it works
### Discriminator Model Calibration
talk about calibrating deep learning models with temperature smoothing

## Experimental Design
To understand how the generative model works we implemented a random sampling with replacement scheme.
We sampling a fixed number of label functions and incorporated them with the baseline model.
We repeated this process 50 times for each sample batch and measures performance in terms of area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC).
