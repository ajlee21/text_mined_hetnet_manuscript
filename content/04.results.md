### Reconstructing Hetionet
After the discriminiative model has been calibrated, we estimated the number of edges that can be added/recalled from Hetionet v1.
Figure {@fig:cocoscore_comparison} shows a comparison between our model and a recently published literature model [@tag:cocoscore]. 
For majority of edge types the literature model outperforms our model.
In respect to Disease associates Gene (DaG) we achieve an area under the receiver operative curve (AUROC) of 77% and an area under the precision recall curve (AUPR) of 26%, while the literature model achieves a score of 81% and 43% resepctively.
The literature model out performed our model when predicting the gene interacts gene (GiG) edge type.
It received an AUROC of 72% and an AUPR of 7%, while our model achieved an AUROC of 71% and an AUPR of 10%.
Our model out performed the literature model for compound treats disease (CtD) and obtained an AUROC of 93% and an AUPR of 36%.
The literature model achieved an AUROC of 91% and an AUPR of 32%.
Both models had the same AUROC performance (74%) for compound binds gene (CbG), but different performance for AUPR (8% our model and 11% literature model).  
Figure {@fig:hetionet_reconstruction}, depicts the number of edges based on precision level.
For DaG we can add 74 new edges while matintaining 70% precision.
Likewise with CtD we can add 10 new edges while maintaining 70% precision.
As for CbG and GiG the models fail to reach precision higher than 0.5 and 0.6 respectively.
Despite the low performance, we are still able to add new edges (7 for CbG at 47% precision and 9 for GiG at 56% precision) to Hetionet v1.

Comparion between our model and CoCoScore model [@tag:cocoscore].
We report both model's performance in terms of area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) and area under then precision recall curve (AUPR).
Our model achieves comparable performance against CoCoScore in terms of AUROC.
As for AUPR CoCoScore consistently outperforms our model except for compound treats disease (CtD).

A scatter plot showing the number of edges (log scale) we can add or recall given the precision level. 
The blue depicts edges exisiting in hetionet and the orange depicts how many novel edges can be added to hetionet.
Note that some edge types do not reach 100% precision.
