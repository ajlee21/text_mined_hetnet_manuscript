The rows depict the relationship each model is trying to predict and the columns are the relationship specific sources each label function is sampled from.
For example, the top-left most square depicts the generative model predicting Disease associates Gene (DaG) sentences, while randomly sampling label functions designed to predict the DaG relationship.

We added randomly sampled label functions to a baseline for each edge type to evaluate the feasibility of label function re-use.
Our baseline model consisted of a generative model trained with only the edge type's distant supervision label functions.
We report the results in the form of area under the precision recall curve (AUPR) (Figure {@fig:gen_model_auprc}) and area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) (Figure {@fig:gen_model_auroc}).  
The on-diagonal plots of figure {@fig:gen_model_auprc}) and figure {@fig:gen_model_auprc} show performance when edge-specific label functions are added on top of edge-specific baselines.
The general trend is performance increases in this setting.
The Compound-treats-Disease (CtD) edge type is a quintessential example of this trend.
The baseline model starts off with an AUROC score of 52% and an AUPRC of 28%, which increase to 76% and 49% respectively as more CtD label functions are included. 
Disease-associates-Gene (DaG) edges have a similar trend: performance starting off with a AUROC of 56% and AUPRC of 41%, which increase to 62% and 45% respectively.
Both the Compound-binds-Gene (CbG) and Gene-interacts-Gene (GiG) edges have an increasing trend but plateau after a few label functions are added.  

The off-diagonals in figure {@fig:gen_model_auprc}) and figure {@fig:gen_model_auprc} show how performance varies when label functions from one edge type are added to a different edge type's baseline.
In certain cases (apparent for DaG), performance increases regardless of the edge type used for label functions.
In other cases (apparent with CtD), one label function appears to improve performance; however, adding more label functions does not improve performance (AUROC) or decreases it (AUPRC).
In certain cases, the source of the label functions appear to be important: for CbG edges performance decreases when using label functions from the DaG and CtD categories.

Our initial hypothesis was based on the idea that certain edge types capture similar physical relationships and that these cases would be particularly amenable for label function transfer.
For example, Compound-binds-Gene (CbG) and Gene-interacts-Gene (GiG) both describe physical interactions.
We observed that performance increased as assessed by both AUPRC and AUPRC when using label functions from the GiG edge type to predict CbG edges.
A similar trend was observed when predicting the GiG edge; however, the performance differences were small for this edge type making the importance difficult to assess.  
The last column shows performance when sampling from all label functions.
Performance increased (AUROC and AUPRC) for both DaG and CtD, when sampling from the full pool of label functions.
CbG and GiG also had increased performance when one random label function was sampled, but performance decreased drastically as more label functions were added.
It is possible that a small number of irrelevant label functions are able to overwhelm the distant supervision label functions in these cases.

### Random Label Function Gen Model Analysis
![
A grid of area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) for each edge type.
Each plot consists of adding a single label function on top of the baseline model.
This label function emits a positive (top row) or negative (bottom row) label at specified frequencies, and performance at zero is equivalent to not having a randomly emitting label function.
The error bars represent 95% confidence intervals for AUROC (y-axis) at each emission frequency.

We observed that including one label function of a mismatched type to distant supervision often improved performance, so we evaluated the effects of adding a random label function in the same setting.
We found that adding random noise did not usually improve performance (Figures {@fig:random_label_function_auprc} and {@fig:random_label_function_auprc}).
For the CbG edge type we did observe slightly increased performance via AUPR (Figure {@fig:random_label_function_auprc}).
However, in general the performance changes were smaller than those observed with mismatched label types.

### Reconstructing Hetionet

After the discriminiative model has been calibrated, we estimated the number of edges that can be added/recalled from Hetionet v1.
Figure {@fig:cocoscore_comparison} shows a comparison between our model and a recently published literature model [@tag:cocoscore]. 
For majority of edge types the literature model outperforms our model.
In respect to Disease associates Gene (DaG) we achieve an area under the receiver operative curve (AUROC) of 77% and an area under the precision recall curve (AUPR) of 26%, while the literature model achieves a score of 81% and 43% resepctively.
The literature model out performed our model when predicting the gene interacts gene (GiG) edge type.
It received an AUROC of 72% and an AUPR of 7%, while our model achieved an AUROC of 71% and an AUPR of 10%.
Our model out performed the literature model for compound treats disease (CtD) and obtained an AUROC of 93% and an AUPR of 36%.
The literature model achieved an AUROC of 91% and an AUPR of 32%.
Both models had the same AUROC performance (74%) for compound binds gene (CbG), but different performance for AUPR (8% our model and 11% literature model).  
Figure {@fig:hetionet_reconstruction}, depicts the number of edges based on precision level.
For DaG we can add 74 new edges while matintaining 70% precision.
Likewise with CtD we can add 10 new edges while maintaining 70% precision.
As for CbG and GiG the models fail to reach precision higher than 0.5 and 0.6 respectively.
Despite the low performance, we are still able to add new edges (7 for CbG at 47% precision and 9 for GiG at 56% precision) to Hetionet v1.

Comparion between our model and CoCoScore model [@tag:cocoscore].
We report both model's performance in terms of area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) and area under then precision recall curve (AUPR).
Our model achieves comparable performance against CoCoScore in terms of AUROC.
As for AUPR CoCoScore consistently outperforms our model except for compound treats disease (CtD).
