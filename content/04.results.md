## Random Sampling of Generative Model
place the grid aurocs here for generative model

## Discriminator Model Builds Off Generative Model

Figure 2. Grid of Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUROC) scores for each discriminator model being trained on labels from the
corresponding generative model. The rows depict the relationship each model is prediction and the columns are the relationships specific
source each label function is being sampled from. As expected in the on diagonals there is a linear trend between the generative model’s
performance and the discriminator model’s performance. When moving towards the off diagonals, the discriminator model’s performance
fluctuates depending on the generative model’s performance.

## Random Noise Generative Model
place the results of random label function experiment

## Reconstructing Hetionet
place figure of number of new edges that can be added to hetionet as well as edges we can reconstruct using this method
