## Generative Model Using Randomly Sampled Label Functions

To evaluate the feasibility of label function reuse we used a random sampling method.
Our baseline model consisted of training the generative model with only distant supervision label functions for each edge type.
We report the results in the form of area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC) (Figure {@fig:gen_model_auprc}) and area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) (Figure {@fig:gen_model_auroc}).  
The general trend is performance increases as the number of edge specific label functions are added on top of the edge specific baseline models.
This trend is shown on the on-diagonals of figure {@fig:gen_model_auprc}) and figure {@fig:gen_model_auprc}.
A quintessential example of this trend is with the compound treats disease (CtD) edge type.
The baseline model starts off with an auroc score of 0.52 and an auprc of 0.28, then increases to 0.76 and 0.49 as the number of edge specific label functions are incorporated. 
The disease associates gene (DaG) edge has a similar trend with performance starting off with a auroc score of 0.56 and auprc score of 0.41 then increasing to 0.62 and 0.45 respectively.
Both the Compound binds Gene (CbG) and Gene interacts Gene (GiG) edges have an increasing trend (auroc of 0.78 to 0.82 and 0.66 to 0.77 respectively), but plateaus as the number of label functions increases.  
For the off-diagonals performance varies upon edge type as some edges can aide in predicting others.
Looking at the DaG row, performance increases regardless of the edge type source.
This trend changes for CtD as performance starts to increase, when only adding one label function, then plateaus (auroc) or decreases (auprc) when more label functions are added.
For CbG performance decreases when using label functions from the DaG and CtD category.
As expected performance increases for both auprc and auroc when using label functions from the GiG edge type.
This trend is shared when predicting the GiG edge; however the magnitude of performance is low.  
Lastly, performance increases (auroc and auprc) for both DaG and CtD, when sampling from all label functions at once.
Interestingly, CbG and GiG share a similar trend of increasing in performance when one random label function is used, but drastically decreases as more label functions are incorporated.

Grid of Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUROC) scores for each generative model trained on randomly sampled label functions.
The rows depict the relationship each model is trying to predict and the columns are the relationship specific sources each label function is sampled from.
For example, the top-left most square depicts the generative model predicting Disease associates Gene (DaG) sentences, while randomly sampling label functions designed to predict the DaG relationship. 
The square towards the right depicts the generative model predicting DaG sentences, while randomly sampling label functions designed to predict the Compound treats Disease (CtD) relationship.
This pattern continues filling out the rest of the grid.
The last most column consists of pooling every relationship specific label function and proceeding as above.
