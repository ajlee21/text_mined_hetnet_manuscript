## Random Sampling of Generative Model
![generative_model](images/figures/label_sampling/transfer_test_set_auroc.png)

Figure 1. Grid of Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUROC) scores for each randomly sampled generative model. The rows depict
the relationship each model is prediction and the columns are the relationships specific source each label function is being sampled from.
For example, the top-left most square depicts the generative model predicting DaG sentences while randomly sampling label functions
designed to predict DaG. The on diagonal shows a positive relationship as one incorporates relevant sources, while the off diagonals show
performance can increase or decrease depending on relationship pairing


## Discriminator Model Builds Off Generative Model
place the grid of aurocs here for discriminator model

## Random Noise Generative Model
place the results of random label function experiment

## Reconstructing Hetionet
place figure of number of new edges that can be added to hetionet as well as edges we can reconstruct using this method
