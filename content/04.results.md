## Random Sampling of Generative Model

We evaluate the feasibility of label function reuse.
Our baseline model consisted of using database specific label functions.
We incorporated randomly sampled relationship specific label functions to build on top of our baseline model (Figure {@fig:gen_model_auroc}).
Performance is positively correlated with the number of relevant label functions added to the model.
This trend is shown on the on-diagonals of the grid. 
Within the off-diagonals performance varies upon relationship type as some relationships are easier to predict than others.
For disease associates gene row performance increases as the number of label functions increases regardless of the label function source.
This trend changes for compound binds gene and gene interacts gene row as the off diagonals show a decreasing trend in performance.
A unique discovery is that performance first increases when adding only one random label function, then performnace deteriorates when adding more irrelevant label functions.
For CtD and GiG models the best performing models are the ones that incorporate the most relevant label functions. 
For DaG the best model is the one using all the label functions at once.
Lastly, the best performing model for compound binds gene is the model that uses label functions from gene interacts gene.

Grid of Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUROC) scores for each generative model trained on randomly sampled label functions.
The rows depict the relationship each model is trying to predict and the columns are the relationship specific sources each label function is sampled from.
For example, the top-left most square depicts the generative model predicting Disease associates Gene (DaG) sentences, while randomly sampling label functions designed to predict the DaG relationship. 
The square towards the right depicts the generative model predicting DaG sentences, while randomly sampling lable functions designed to predict Compound treats Disease (CtD) relationships.
This pattern continues filling out the rest of the grid.
The last most column consists of pooling every relationship specific label function and proceeding as above.
