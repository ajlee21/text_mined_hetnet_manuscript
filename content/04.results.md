### Generative Model Using Randomly Sampled Label Functions

Creating label functions is a labor intensive process that can take days to accomplish.
We sought to accelerate this process by measuring the extent to which label functions can be reused.
Our hypothesis is that certain edge types share similar linguistic features such as keywords and/or sentence structure.
This shared characteristic would make certain edge types amenable to label function reuse.
We incorporated a sampling approach to test this hypothesis on an individual level (edge vs edge) as well as a global level (collective pool of sources). 
We report results in terms of AUROC (Figures {@fig:auroc_gen_model_test_set} and {@fig:auroc_grabbag_gen_model_test_set}) and AUPR (Supplemental Figure {@fig:aupr_gen_model_test_set} and {@fig:aupr_grabbag_gen_model_test_set}).

Performance increases when edge-specific label functions are added to an edge-specific baseline model, while label function reusability shows modest results.
The quintessential example of the first trend is the Compound treats Disease (CtD) edge type, where edge-specific label functions completely dominates the edge-mismatch label functions.
A mildly similar trend can be seen within the Compound binds Gene (CbG) and Gene interacts Gene (GiG) edge types as edge-specific label functions dominate performance.
CbG and GiG show positive signs of label function transferability. 
Performance increases as more CbG label functions are incorporated to the GiG baseline model and vise-versa.
This suggests that sentences for GiG and CbG may share similar linguistic features or terminology that allows for label functions to be reused.
Perplexingly, edge-specific Disease associates Gene (DaG) label functions fail to outcompete other label function sources.
Overall, only CbG and GiG show significant signs of reusability which suggests label functions could be shared between the two edge types.

Edge-specific label functions improves performance over edge-mismatch label functions.
Each line plot header depicts the edge type the generative model is trying to predict, while the colors represent the source of label functions.
For example orange represents sampling label functions designed to predict the Compound treats Disease (CtD) edge type.
The x axis shows the number of randomly sampled label functions being incorporated onto the database only baseline model (point at 0).
The y axis shows area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC).
Each point on the plot shows the average of 50 sample runs, while the error bars show the 95% confidence intervals of all runs.
The baseline and “All” data points consist of sampling from the entire fixed set of label functions.
This makes the error bars appear flat.

Utilizing all label functions at once generally hinders performance of the generative model.
Typically as more label functions are being sampled the gap between edge-specific sources and the all category widen.
CbG is a prime example of this trend (Figure {#fig:auroc_grabbag_gen_model_test_set}), while CtD and GiG show a similar but milder trend.
We expected this trend to occur, since most edge-mismatch label functions showed a deteriorating trend in Figure {#fig:auroc_gen_model_test_set}.
An exception to the shared consensus is DaG where the pooled set of label functions improved performance over the edge-specific case.
The decreasing trend when pooling all label functions supports the notion that label functions cannot easily transfer between edge types (exception being CbG on GiG and vise versa).
