### Reconstructing Hetionet
Once the discriminiative model has been calibrated, we compared our model to a baseline model [@tag:cocoscore] (Figure {@fig:cocoscore_comparison}) and  estimated the number of edges that can be added/recalled from Hetionet v1 (Figure Figure {@fig:hetionet_reconstruction}).
Regarding model comparison we evaluated edge prediction performance using all edges assigned to our test set.
Scores for both models are reported in the form of area under the receiver operative curve (AUROC) and area under the precision recall curve (AUPR).
The baseline model outperforms our model for majority of edge types.
Our model achieves an AUROC of 78% and an AUPR of 28% for Disease-associates-Gene (DaG), while the baseline model achieves a score of 82% and 45% resepctively.
For Gene-interacts-Gene the baseline model achieved an AUROC of 73% and an AUPR of 11%, while our model achieved an AUROC of 72% and an AUPR of 7%.
Our model out performed the literature model for Compound-treats-Disease (CtD) by obtaining an AUROC of 94% and an AUPR of 40%.
The baseline model achieved an AUROC of 89% and an AUPR of 28%.
The baseline model achieved an AUROC of 74% and AUPR of 11% for Compound-binds-Gene (CbG), while our model achieved an AUROC of 73% and an AUPR of 8%.  
Despite model performance, we are still able to add new edges to Hetionet v1.
For DaG we are able to recall 4 already established edges with 100% precision.
At precision of 60% we can add 14 new edges to Hetionet v1.
With CtD we can recall 2 already establed edges with 100% precision and as precision level decreases to 60% we can add 2 new edges.
Both CbG and GiG the models have a drastic decrease as the precision level increases to 50%.
We were able to recall one existing edge for both edge types with 100% precision. 
Despite the low performance, we are still able to add a few new edges to Hetionet v1.

Comparion between our model and CoCoScore model [@tag:cocoscore].
We report both model's performance in terms of area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) and area under then precision recall curve (AUPR).
Our model achieves comparable performance against CoCoScore in terms of AUROC.
As for AUPR CoCoScore consistently outperforms our model except for compound treats disease (CtD).

A scatter plot showing the number of edges (log scale) we can add or recall given the precision level. 
The blue depicts edges exisiting in hetionet and the orange depicts how many novel edges can be added to hetionet.
Note that some edge types do not reach 100% precision.
