## Reconstructing Hetionet
After the discriminiative model has been calibrated, we estimated the number of edges that can be added/recalled to Hetionet v1.
Figure {@fig:hetionet_reconstruction}, depicts the number of edges based on precision level.
For Disease associates Gene (DaG) we can add 74 new edges while matintaining 70% precision.
Likewise with Compound treats Disease (CtD) we can add 10 new edges while maintaining 70% precision.
As for Compound binds Gene (CbG) and Gene interacts Gene (GiG) the models fail to reach precision higher than 0.5 and 0.6 respectively.
Despite the low performance, we are still able to add new edges that Hetionet v1 hasn't seen before.

A scatter plot showing the number of edges (log scale) we can add or recall given the precision level. 
The blue depicts edges exisiting in hetionet and the orange depicts how many novel edges can be added to hetionet.
Note that some edge types do not reach 100% precision.
