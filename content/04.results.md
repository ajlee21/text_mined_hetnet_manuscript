We added randomly sampled label functions to a baseline for each edge type to evaluate the feasibility of label function re-use.
Our baseline model consisted of a generative model trained with only edge-specific distant supervision label functions.
We reported the results in AUROC and AUPR (Figures {@fig:auroc_gen_model_test_set} and {@fig:aupr_gen_model_test_set}; Supplemental Figures {@fig:auroc_gen_model_tune_set} and {@fig:auroc_gen_model_tune_set}).  
Performance increases as the number of edge-specific label functions is added to the baseline model (Figures {@fig:auroc_gen_model_test_set} and {@fig:aupr_gen_model_test_set}). 
The Compound treats Disease (CtD) edge type is a quintessential example of this trend.
The baseline model starts off with an AUROC score of 52% and an AUPRC of 29%, then performance increases to 76% and 48% respectively as more CtD related label functions are included. 
Gene interacts Gene (GiG), Disease associates Gene (DaG) and Compound binds Gene (CbG) edge types share a similar trend.
Baseline performance starts off with an AUROC of 57% for DaG, 78% for CbG and 66% for GiG, then increases to 62% for DaG, 81% for CbG and 75% for GiG.
Similarly with AUPR, the baseline starts off at 43% for DaG, 29% for CbG and 30% for GiG, then increases to 44%, 30% and 35% respectively.

We based our initial hypothesis on the idea that certain edge types would share related linguistic features and terminology which would be amenable to label function transfer.
For example, sentences for edges CbG and GiG typically describe physical interactions whether it be between a compound and a gene or a pair of two protein produced from genes.
We observed performance increases in terms of both AUROC and AUPR when using label functions from the GiG edge type to predict CbG edges (Figures {@fig:auroc_gen_model_test_set} and {@fig:aupr_gen_model_test_set}).
Likewise when using CbG related label function to predict the GiG edge type; however, in both cases GiG related label functions out performed the CbG related label functions.
Regarding DaG, each label function source had similar performance when predicting the test set (Figures {@fig:auroc_gen_model_test_set} and {@fig:aupr_gen_model_test_set}); however the difference is more apparent when predicting the tune set (Supplemental Figures {@fig:auroc_gen_model_tune_set} and {@fig:auroc_gen_model_tune_set}).

We pooled together all non-database label functions for each edge type.
We randomly sampled label functions from the combined pool, then trained a generative model to predict each edge type.
Performance is report in terms of AUROC and AUPR (Figures {@fig:auroc_grabbag_gen_model_test_set} and {@fig:aupr_grabbag_gen_model_test_set}; Supplemental Figures @fig:auroc_grabbag_gen_model_tune_set} and @fig:aupr_grabbag_gen_model_tune_set}).
General consensus for CbG, GiG and CtD edges is that using all label functions hurt performance.
The gap between edge specific sources and the all category widens as the number of sampled label functions increases.
The only exception to this is DaG where performance increases (57% to 65% AUROC and 43% to 47% AUPR) as more and more label functions are added to the baseline model.

Overall, only CbG and GiG show significant signs of transferability between each other for both Tune and Test set.
DaG shows conflicting results between the tune and test set, when it comes to sampling individual off-edge label functions; however, when pooling every label function together performance increases. 
In terms of CtD, only edge-specific label function increase performance, while off-edge label function hinders performance.
