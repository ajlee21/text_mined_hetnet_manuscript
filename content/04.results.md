## Random Sampling of Generative Model
place the grid aurocs here for generative model

## Discriminator Model Builds Off Generative Model
We evaluate how well the discriminator model builds off of the generative model.

![
Grid of Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUROC) scores for each discriminative model trained using generated labels from the generative models.
The rows depict the relationship each model is trying to predict and the columns are the relationship specific sources each label function was sampled from. 
For example, the top-left most square depicts the discriminator model predicting Disease associates Gene (DaG) sentences, while randomly sampling label functions designed to predict the DaG relationship. 
The square towards the right depicts the discriminative model predicting DaG sentences, while randomly sampling label functions designed to predict the Compound treats Disease (CtD) relationship.
This pattern continues filling out the rest of the grid.
The last most column consists of pooling every relationship specific label function and proceeding as above.

## Random Noise Generative Model
place the results of random label function experiment

## Reconstructing Hetionet
place figure of number of new edges that can be added to hetionet as well as edges we can reconstruct using this method
