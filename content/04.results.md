### Generative Model Using Randomly Sampled Label Functions

Creating label functions is a labor intensive process that can take days to accomplish.
We sought to accelerate this process by measuring the extent to which label functions can be reused.
Our hypothesis was that certain edge types share similar linguistic features such as keywords and/or sentence structure.
This shared characteristic would make certain edge types amenable to label function reuse.
We designed a set of experiments to test this hypothesis on an individual level (edge vs edge) as well as a global level (collective pool of sources). 
We report results in terms of AUROC (Figures {@fig:auroc_gen_model_test_set} and {@fig:auroc_grabbag_gen_model_test_set}) and AUPR (Supplemental Figure {@fig:aupr_gen_model_test_set} and {@fig:aupr_grabbag_gen_model_test_set}).

Performance increases when edge-specific label functions are added to an edge-specific baseline model, while label function reusability shows modest results.
The quintessential example of the overarching trend is the Compound treats Disease (CtD) edge type, where edge-specific label functions always outperformed transferred label functions.
However, there are hints of label function transferability for selected edge types and label function sources. 
Performance increases as more CbG label functions are incorporated to the GiG baseline model and vise-versa.
This suggests that sentences for GiG and CbG may share similar linguistic features or terminology that allows for label functions to be reused.
Edge-specific Disease associates Gene (DaG) label functions did not improve performance over label functions drawn from other edge types.
Overall, only CbG and GiG show significant signs of reusability which suggests label functions could be shared between the two edge types.

Edge-specific label functions are better performing than edge-mismatch label functions but certain mismatch situations show signs of successful transfer.
Each line plot header depicts the edge type the generative model is trying to predict, while the colors represent the source of label functions.
For example orange represents sampling label functions designed to predict the Compound treats Disease (CtD) edge type.
The x axis shows the number of randomly sampled label functions being incorporated onto the database only baseline model (point at 0).
The y axis shows area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC).
Each point on the plot shows the average of 50 sample runs, while the error bars show the 95% confidence intervals of all runs.
The baseline and “All” data points consist of sampling from the entire fixed set of label functions.

We found that sampling from all label function sources at once usually underperformed relative to edge-specific label functions (Figure {#fig:auroc_grabbag_gen_model_test_set}).
As more label functions were sampled, the gap between edge-specific sources and all sources widened.
CbG is a prime example of this trend (Figure {#fig:auroc_grabbag_gen_model_test_set}), while CtD and GiG show a similar but milder trend.
DaG was the exception to the general rule: the pooled set of label functions improved performance over the edge-specific ones, which aligns with the previously observed results for individual edge types (Figure {#fig:auroc_gen_model_test_set}).
The decreasing trend when pooling all label functions supports the notion that label functions cannot easily transfer between edge types (exception being CbG on GiG and vise versa).
