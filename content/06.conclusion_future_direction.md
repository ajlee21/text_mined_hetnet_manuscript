## Conclusion and Future Direction

Filling out knowledge bases via manual curation can be an arduous and erroneous task [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btm229].
As the rate of publications increases manual curation becomes an infeasible approach.
Data programming, a paradigm that uses label functions a means to speed up the annotation process, can be used as a solution for this problem.
A problem with this paradigm is creating a useful label function takes significant amount of time.
We tested the feasibility of reusing label functions as a way to speed up the process of creating label functions.
Based on our findings, we conclude that label functions can be reused across edge types.
Adding more relavant label functions can increase overall performance.
The discriminative model, under this paradigm, has a tendency to overfit to predictions of the generative model.
We recommend implementing regularization techniques such as drop out and weight decay to combat this issue.
Lastly, this work lays the foundation for creating a robust multi-relationship extractor (aka multitask learning [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0200699]).
Through this system we can quickly scale Hetionet and provide researchers with quick access to new findings and publications.
