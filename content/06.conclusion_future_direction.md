## Conclusion and Future Direction

Filling out knowledge bases via manual curation can be an arduous and erroneous task [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btm229].
As the rate of publications increases, relying on manual curation alone becomes impractical.
Data programming, a paradigm that uses label functions as a means to speed up the annotation process, can be used as a solution for this problem.
An obstacle for this paradigm is creating useful label functions, which takes a considerable amount of time. 
We tested the feasibility of reusing label functions as a way to reduce the total number of label functions required for strong prediction performance.
We conclude that label functions may be re-used with closely related edge types, but that re-use does not improve performance for most pairings.
The discriminative model's performance improves as more edge-specific label functions are incorporated into the generative model; however, we did notice that performance greatly depends on the generative model.

This work sets up the foundation for creating a common framework that mines text to create edges.
Within this framework we would continuously ingest new knowledge as novel findings are published, while providing a single confidence score for an edge via sentence score consolidation.
As opposed to many existing knowledge graphs, for example Hetionet v1 where text-derived edges generally cannot be exactly attributed to excerpts from literature [@doi:10.7554/eLife.26726; @doi:10.15363/thinklab.d67], our approach has the potential to annotate each edge based on its source sentences.
In addition, edges generated with this approach would be unencumbered from upstream licensing or copyright restrictions, enabling openly licensed hetnets at a scale not previously possible [@doi:10.15363/thinklab.d107; @doi:10.1038/536016a; @doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0213090].
New multitask learning [@doi:10.1145/3209889.3209898] strategies may make it even more practical to reuse label functions to construct continuously updating literature-derived knowledge graphs.
