## Conclusion and Future Direction

Filling out knowledge bases via manual curation can be an arduous and erroneous task [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btm229].
As the rate of publications increases manual curation becomes an infeasible approach.
Data programming, a paradigm that uses label functions a means to speed up the annotation process, can be used as a solution for this problem.
A problem with this paradigm is creating a useful label function takes significant amount of time.
We tested the feasibility of reusing label functions as a way to speed up the process of creating label functions.
Based on our findings, we conclude that label functions can be reused across edge types.
Adding more relavant label functions can increase overall performance.
The discriminative model, under this paradigm, has a tendency to overfit to predictions of the generative model.
We recommend implementing regularization techniques such as drop out and weight decay to combat this issue.

This work sets up the foundation for creating a common framework that uses text to create edges.
Within this framework we can continuously ingest new knowledge as novel findings are published and provide confidence scores for each edge.
Furthermore, we can release our findings apart from journal licensing restrictions and allow users to transition from edges to relevant sentences and publications.
Conclusively, we plan to use this framework to create a robust multi-edge extractor via multitask learning [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0200699].
