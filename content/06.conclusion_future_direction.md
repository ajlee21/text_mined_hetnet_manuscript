## Conclusion and Future Direction

Relationship extraction via manual curation can be an arduous task.
Data programming, a paradigm that uses label functions a means to speed up the annotation process,  can be used as a solution speed up and ease this arduous task.
The caveat towards this paradigm is that creating a useful label function takes a signficant amount of time. 
We tested the feasibility of resuing label functions to speed up not only the creation process, but to speed up relationship extraction itself.
We found that researchers should have a generalized set of negative label functions and spend more of their time constructing positive label functions.
Also we notice that more label functions equates to better performance.
For the future we plan to construct a unified system that can extract multiple relationships at once (multitask learning). 
By building this system we could consistently Hetionet with newly discovered literature and find new and exciting results.
