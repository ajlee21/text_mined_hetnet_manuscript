## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Knowledge-bases are useful resources that aide in multiple processes such as network construction and analysis, providing researchers contextual information, and more.
Majority of these knowledge-bases are populated through manual curation.
This process is a time consuming and on the verge of being infeasible as the publication rate constantly rises.
A recently discovered paradigm, called Data Programming, can circumvent this arduous process.
This paradigm uses simple rules and heuristics via simply pythonic functions called label functions to speed up the annotation process.
A caveat towards this paradigm is that constructing a useful label function is a non trivial task.
Empirically, a useful function can take approximately a few days to construct.
To fill out a complete knowledge-base this process can take on the verge of years to complete.
In this paper we aim to speed up this process by determining the feasibility of re-using label functions. 
With Hetionet v1 as our knowledge-base, we evaluate this process by predicting the following edge types: Disease-associates-Gene (DaG), Compound-treats-Disease (CtD), Compound-binds-Gene (CbG), and Gene-interacts-Gene (GiG).
We start off by using database oriented label functions as our baseline model.
Using a sampling with replacement approach we randomly sample other label functions to build off the baseline model.
We report our prediction performance in the form of area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) and area under the precision recall curve (AUPR).
Through extensive sampling we achieved decent prediction performance and determined that label functions can be reused across edge types.
Lastly, we show that this approach can add novel edges to Hetionet v1, which allows us to quickly populate Hetionet v1 with novel publications and findings.
