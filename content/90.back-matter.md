### Label Function Categories

We provide examples of label function categories below. Each example regards the following candidate sentence: “[PTK6]{.gene_color} may be a novel therapeutic target for [pancreatic cancer]{.disease_color}.”

**Databases**: These label functions incorporate existing databases to generate a signal, as seen in distant supervision [@doi:10.3115/1690219.1690287].
These functions detect if a candidate sentence's co-mention pair is present in a given database.
If the candidate pair is present, our label function emitted a positive label and abstained otherwise.
If the candidate pair wasn't present in any existing database, a separate label function emitted a negative label.
We used a separate label function to prevent a label imbalance problem that we encountered during development: emitting positive and negatives from the same label functions appeared to result in classifiers that predict almost exclusively negative predictions.

$$ \Lambda_{DB}(\color{#875442}{D}, \color{#02b3e4}{G}) = 
\begin{cases}
 1 & (\color{#875442}{D}, \color{#02b3e4}{G}) \in DB \\
0 & otherwise \\
\end{cases} $$

$$ \Lambda_{\neg DB}(\color{#875442}{D}, \color{#02b3e4}{G}) = 
\begin{cases}
 -1 & (\color{#875442}{D}, \color{#02b3e4}{G}) \notin DB \\
0 & otherwise \\
\end{cases} $$

**Text Patterns**: These label functions are designed to use keywords and sentence context to generate a signal. 
For example, a label function could focus on the number of words between two mentions or focus on the grammatical structure of a sentence.
These functions emit a positive or negative label depending on the situation.

$$ \Lambda_{TP}(\color{#875442}{D}, \color{#02b3e4}{G}) = 
\begin{cases}
 1 & "target" \> \in Candidate \> Sentence \\
 0 & otherwise \\
\end{cases} $$

$$ \Lambda_{TP}(\color{#875442}{D}, \color{#02b3e4}{G}) = 
\begin{cases}
 -1 & 	"VB" \> \notin pos\_tags(Candidate \> Sentence) \\
 0 & otherwise \\
\end{cases} $$


**Domain Heuristics**: These label functions use the other experiment results to generate a signal. 
For this category, we used dependency path cluster themes generated by Percha et al. [@tag:global_network].
If a candidate sentence's dependency path belongs to a previously generated cluster, then the label function will emit a positive label and abstain otherwise.

$$
\Lambda_{DH}(\color{#875442}{D}, \color{#02b3e4}{G}) = \begin{cases}
    1 & Candidate \> Sentence \in Cluster \> Theme\\
    0 & otherwise \\
    \end{cases}
$$

Roughly half of our label functions are based on text patterns, while the others are distributed across the databases and domain heuristics (Table {@tbl:label-functions}).

| Relationship | Databases (DB) | Text Patterns (TP) | Domain Heuristics (DH) |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| DaG | 7 | 20 | 10 | 
| CtD | 3 | 15 | 7 |
| CbG | 9 | 13 | 7 | 
| GiG | 9 | 20 | 8 |

### Adding Random Noise to Generative Model

We discovered in the course of this work that adding a single label function from a mismatched type would often improve the performance of the generative model (see Results).
We designed an experiment to test whether adding a noisy label function also increased performance.
This label function emitted a positive or negative label at varying frequencies, which were evenly spaced from zero to one.
Zero was the same as distant supervision and one meant that all sentences were randomly labeled.
We trained the generative model with these label functions added and reported results in terms of AUROC and AUPR.

### Discriminative Model

The discriminative model is a neural network, which we train to predict labels from the generative model.
The expectation is that the discriminative model can learn more complete features of the text than the label functions used in the generative model.
We used a convolutional neural network with multiple filters as our discriminative model.
This network uses multiple filters with fixed widths of 300 dimensions and a fixed height of 7 (Figure {@fig:convolutional_network}), because this height provided the best performance in terms of relationship classification [@arxiv:1510.03820].
We trained this model for 20 epochs using the adam optimizer [@arxiv:1412.6980] with pytorch's default parameter settings and a learning rate of 0.001.
We added a L2 penalty on the network weights to prevent overfitting.
Lastly, we added a dropout layer (p=0.25) between the fully connected layer and the softmax layer.

![
The architecture of the discriminative model was a convolutional neural network.
We performed a convolution step using multiple filters. 
The filters generated a feature map that was sent into a maximum pooling layer that was designed to extract the largest feature in each map.
The extracted features were concatenated into a singular vector that was passed into a fully connected network. 
The fully connected network had 300 neurons for the first layer, 100 neurons for the second layer and 50 neurons for the last layer. 
The last step from the fully connected network was to generate predictions using a softmax layer.

#### Word Embeddings

Word embeddings are representations that map individual words to real valued vectors of user-specified dimensions.
These embeddings have been shown to capture the semantic and syntactic information between words [@arxiv:1310.4546].
We trained Facebook's fastText [@arxiv:1607.04606] using all candidate sentences for each individual relationship pair to generate word embeddings.
fastText uses a skipgram model [@arxiv:1301.3781] that aims to predict the surrounding context for a candidate word and pairs the model with a novel scoring function that treats each word as a bag of character n-grams.
We trained this model for 20 epochs using a window size of 2 and generated 300-dimensional word embeddings.
We use the optimized word embeddings to train a discriminative model. 

#### Calibration of the Discriminative Model

Often many tasks require a machine learning model to output reliable probability predictions. 
A model is well calibrated if the probabilities emitted from the model match the observed probabilities: a well-calibrated model that assigns a class label with 80% probability should have that class appear 80% of the time.
Deep neural network models can often be poorly calibrated [@arxiv:1706.04599; @arxiv:1807.00263].
These models are usually over-confident in their predictions.
As a result, we calibrated our convolutional neural network using temperature scaling. 
Temperature scaling uses a parameter T to scale each value of the logit vector (z) before being passed into the softmax (SM) function.

$$\sigma_{SM}(\frac{z_{i}}{T}) = \frac{\exp(\frac{z_{i}}{T})}{\sum_{i}\exp(\frac{z_{i}}{T})}$$

We found the optimal T by minimizing the negative log likelihood (NLL) of a held out validation set.
The benefit of using this method is that the model becomes more reliable and the accuracy of the model doesn't change [@arxiv:1706.04599].

### Generative Model Using Randomly Sampled Label Functions

#### Individual Sources

Edge-specific label functions improves performance over edge-mismatch label functions.
Each line plot header depicts the edge type the generative model is trying to predict, while the colors represent the source of label functions.
For example orange represents sampling label functions designed to predict the Compound treats Disease (CtD) edge type.
The x axis shows the number of randomly sampled label functions being incorporated onto the database only baseline model (point at 0).
The y axis shows area under the precision recall curve (AUPR).
Each point on the plot shows the average of 50 sample runs, while the error bars show the 95% confidence intervals of all runs.
The baseline and “All” data points consist of sampling from the entire fixed set of label functions.

### Discriminative Model Performance

![
Grid of AUROC scores for each discriminative model trained using generated labels from the generative models.
The rows depict the edge type each model is trying to predict and the columns are the edge type specific sources from which each label function was sampled. 
For example, the top-left most square depicts the discriminator model predicting DaG sentences, while randomly sampling label functions designed to predict the DaG relationship.
The error bars over the points represents the standard deviation between sampled runs.
The square towards the right depicts the discriminative model predicting DaG sentences, while randomly sampling label functions designed to predict the CtD relationship.
This pattern continues filling out the rest of the grid.
The right most column consists of pooling every relationship specific label function and proceeding as above.

In this framework we used a generative model trained over label functions to produce probabilistic training labels for each sentence.
Then we trained a discriminative model, which has full access to a representation of the text of the sentence, to predict the generated labels.
The discriminative model is a convolutional neural network trained over word embeddings (See Methods).
We report the results of the discriminative model using AUROC and AUPR (Figures {@fig:auroc_discriminative_model_performance} and {@fig:aupr_discriminative_model_performance}).  
  
We found that the discriminative model under-performed the generative model in most cases.
Only for the CtD edge does the discriminative model appear to provide performance above the generative model and that increased performance is only with a modest number of label functions.
With the full set of label functions, performance of both models remain similar.
The one or a few mismatched label functions (off-diagonal) improving generative model performance trend is retained despite the limited performance of the discriminative model.

### Discriminative Model Calibration

Even deep learning models with high precision and recall can be poorly calibrated, and the overconfidence of these models has been noted [@arxiv:1706.04599; @arxiv:1807.00263].
We attempted to calibrate the best performing discriminative model so that we could directly use the emitted probabilities.
We examined the calibration of our existing model (Supplemental Figure {@fig:discriminative_model_calibration}, blue line).
We found that the DaG and CtG edge types were, though not perfectly calibrated, were somewhat aligned with the ideal calibration lines.
The CbG and GiG edges were poorly calibrated and increasing model certainty did not always lead to an increase in precision.
Applying the calibration algorithm (orange line) did not appear to bring predictions in line with the ideal calibration line, but did capture some of the uncertainty in the GiG edge type.
For this reason we use the measured precision instead of the predicted probabilities when determining how many edges could be added to existing knowledge bases with specified levels of confidence.

### Baseline Comparison

![
Comparion between our model and CoCoScore model [@tag:cocoscore].
We report both model's performance in terms of AUROC and AUPR.
Our model achieves comparable performance against CoCoScore in terms of AUROC.
As for AUPR, CoCoScore consistently outperforms our model except for CtD. 
](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danich1/snorkeling/0149086785b19f9429c92565d650e9d049c136ff/figures/literature_models/model_comparison.png){#fig:cocoscore_comparison}

Once our discriminator model is calibrated, we grouped sentences based on mention pair (edges).
We assigned each edge the maximum score over all grouped sentences and compared our model's ability to predict pairs in our test set to a previously published baseline model [@tag:cocoscore].
Performance is reported in terms of AUROC and AUPR (Figure {@fig:cocoscore_comparison}).
Across edge types our model shows comparable performance against the baseline in terms of AUROC.
Regarding AUPR, our model shows hindered performance against the baseline.
The exception for both cases is CtD where our model performs better than the baseline.

### Reconstructing Hetionet

![
A scatter plot showing the number of edges (log scale) we can add or recall at specified precision levels. 
The blue depicts edges existing in hetionet and the orange depicts how many novel edges can be added.
](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danich1/snorkeling/0149086785b19f9429c92565d650e9d049c136ff/figures/edge_prediction_experiment/edges_added.png){#fig:hetionet_reconstruction}

We evaluated how many edges we can recall/add to Hetionet v1 (Supplemental Figure {@fig:hetionet_reconstruction} and Table {@tbl:edge_prediction_tbl}).
In our evaluation we used edges assigned to our test set.
Overall, we can recall a small amount of edges at high precision thresholds.
A key example is CbG and GiG where we recalled only one exisiting edge at 100% precision.
Despite the low recall, we are still able to add novel edges to DaG and CtD while retaining modest precision.
