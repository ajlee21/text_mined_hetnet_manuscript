## Introduction

Knowledge bases are important resources that hold complex structured and unstructed information. 
These resources have been used in important tasks such as network analysis for drug repurposing discovery [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0084912; @doi:10.1101/385617; @doi:10.7554/eLife.26726] or as a source of training labels for text mining systems [@doi:10.3115/1690219.1690287; @doi:10.1101/444398; @doi:10.1186/s12859-019-2873-7]. 
Populating knowledge bases often requires highly-trained scientists to read biomedical literature and summarize the results [@doi:10.1093/bib/bbn043].
This manual curation process requires a significant amount of effort and time: in 2007 researchers estimated that filling in the missing annotations to that point would require approximately 8.4 years [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btm229]).
The rate of publications has continued to increase exponentially [@doi:10.1002/asi.23329].
This has been recognized as a considerable challenge and leads to gaps in knowledge bases [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btm229].  
Relationship extraction has been studied as a solution towards handling this problem [@doi:10.1093/bib/bbn043].
This process consists of creating a machine learning system to automatically scan and extract relationships from textual sources.
Machine learning methods often leverage a large corpus of well-labeled training data, which still requires manual curation.
Distant supervision is one technique to sidestep the requirement of well-annotated sentences: with distant supervision one makes the assumption that that all sentences containing an entity pair found in a selected database provide evidence for a relationship [@doi:10.3115/1690219.1690287].
Distant supervision provides many labeled examples; however it is accompanied by a decrease in the quality of the labels.  
Ratner et al. [@arxiv:1605.07723] recently introduced "data programming" as a solution.
Data programming combines distant supervision with the automated labeling of text using hand-written label functions.
The distant supervision sources and label functions are integrated using a noise aware generative model, which is used to produce training labels.
Combining distant supervision with label functions can dramatically reduce the time required to acquire sufficient training data.
However, constructing a knowledge base of heterogeneous relationships through this framework still requires tens of hand-written label functions for each relationship type.
Writing useful label functions requires significant error analysis, which can be a time-consuming process.  

In this paper, we aim to address the question: to what extent can label functions be re-used across different relationship types?
We hypothesized that sentences describing one relationship type may share information in the form of keywords or sentence structure with sentences that indicate other relationship types.
We designed a series of experiments to determine the extent to which label function re-use enhanced performance over distant supervision alone.
We examine relationships that indicate similar types of physical interactions (i.e., gene-binds-gene and compound-binds-gene) as well as different types (i.e., disease-associates-gene and compound-treats-disease).
The re-use of label functions could dramatically reduce the number required to generate and update a heterogeneous knowledge graph.
