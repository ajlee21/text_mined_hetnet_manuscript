## Recent Work
Relationship extraction has can be broken down into three categories of approaches: (1) unsupervised learning such as using co-occurence scores and clustering, (2) developing hand crafted rules and patterns to text extract relationship, (3) use of supervised machine learning techniques.  
For disease gene associations (DaG), there has been work that uses co-occurence scores [@doi:10.1016/j.ymeth.2014.11.020 (Diseases Paper); @doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btw358 (BeFree)].
This approach provides significatn performance in terms of recall, but under perform in terms of precision.
Song et al., use a different approach that incorporated the use of rules to perform extraction [@doi:10.1016/j.jbi.2015.08.008 (PKDE4J)].
Polysearch is a text mining tool that uses some approach I need to read more about [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkv383 (polysearch)].
Using supervised machine learing techniques significant amount of algorithms used a support vector machine to perform extraction [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btw503 (DTMiner); @doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0200699 (ensemble svm)].
Majority of these algorithms use hand crafted datasets to evaluate their method.  

In respect to compound treats disease (CtD) relationship extraction, recent work has involved using co-occurence [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000943 (CoPub Discovery)].  

For compound binds to gene there has been work on combining machine learning with predefined rules and pattern matching to extract information [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkx462 (Limtox)].  

For gene interacts with gene (GiG) relationships, also considered protein protein interactions, there has been a lot of work on the subject.
There was an open task that invovled seeing if uses can develop the best model to extract protein protein interactions [@doi:10.1186/gb-2008-9-s2-s4 (Biocreative II)].
The best performing model here was __, which is an ensemble method.
Another method that extracted this information used a Bi-LSTM model [@doi:10.1016/j.knosys.2018.11.020 (Feature Assisted)]

Depsite the relationship specific methods, recent work has shifted towards extract multiple relationships at once. 
One approach took a bi-clustering of dependency trees paths using Medline abstracts to extract multiple relationships [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty114].
Another method used an updated co-occurence score approach to effectively extract information [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btz490 (CoCoScore)].
another approach pepople have used to extract realtionships is to use crowd sourcing, which involves using people to construct your dataset [@doi:10.1101/564187].
