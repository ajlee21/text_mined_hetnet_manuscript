### Related Work
Relationship extraction is the process of detecting and classifying semantic relationships from a collection of text.
This process of can be broken down into three categories: (1) use of natural langue processing techniques such as manual crafted rules, dictionary lookups or text patterns to extract relationships from literature, (2) unsupervised machine learning via co-occurence scores or clustering approaches, and (3) supervised or semi-supervised machine learning using annotated datasets for classification of documents or sentences.
We discuss previous work done for each type of edge (relationship) studied in this project.

#### Disease-Gene Associations 
Regarding rule based approaches, Liu et al. used a dictionary lookup approach to extract multiple edges involving diseases, genes, toxins, etc. from literature [@tag:polysearch]. 
Song et al., created a text mining tool called PKDE4J which uses a dictionary and rule based approaches to extract associations from literature [@tag:pkde4j].
Despite the great performance, these approach takes significant amount of manual effort to use.  
In the context of unsupervised approaches, Pletscher-Frankild et al., used a co-occurence approach to predict disease-gene associations [@tag:diseases].
Each disease and gene pair were ranked based on their mention frequency within in biomedical abstracts.
Junge et al., used an advanced version of the DISEASES approach that combines co-occurence scores with a distant supervision approach to identify disease gene associations [@tag:cocoscore].
Kim et al., used a co-occurence scores to construct a disease-gene network to find associations [@tag:lgscore].
Zhou et al., combined term weights with co-occurence methods to improve performance on association identification [@tag:dg_text_pubmed].
Westergaard et al., used a co-occurence approach using full text to detect associations [@tag:full_text_co_abstracts].
Besides co-occurence, Percha et al., used a bi-clustering approach on dependency trees generated from MEDLINE abstracts to detect associations [@tag:global_network].
These kind of approaches have powerful recall performance, but can suffer precision wise.  
With the availability of hand annotated datasets [@tag:befree; @tag:eu_adr; @tag:comagc], there have been a number of supervised machine learning approaches for classifying associations.
Quan et al., used a maximum entropy classifier to classify sentences that indicate an association [@tag:dg_extract_txt_network].
Bravo et al., used a support vector machine classifier with two different kernels, a dependency kernel and a shallow linguistic kernel, to classify associations [@tag:befree]. 
Xu and Zhang et al., used a support vector machine classifier with local and global context features to classify associations in literature [@tag:dtminer].
Recently Bhasuran et al., created used an ensemble approach that consisted of using multiple support vector machines to identify associations [@tag:ensemble_svm].
Lee et al., build off of the BERT [@tag:bert] system to build a deep learning classifier for association detection [@tag:biobert].

#### Compound Treats Disease
For rule based extraction, Xu et al., created a pattern learning approach that used MEDLINE abstracts to identify compound disease treatments [@tag:ctd_medline]
For unsupervised approaches, Frijters et al., used a co-occurence approach to find novel disease targets fro drugs [@tag:copub_discovery].

Percha et al., used a bi-clustering approach on dependency trees generated from MEDLINE abstracts to extract compound disease treatments [@tag:global_network].
Majority of work for supervised machine learning is centered around the biocreative shared task [@doi:10.1093/database/baw032 (Biocreative V)].
This task was focused on predicting compound inducing disease relationship, which is tangential towards this project.

#### Compound Binds Gene
Majority of work for this edge type revolves around biocreative task VI track 5 [@raw:biocreative/chemprot].
This text mining shared task challenged contestants to classify compound protein (genes for our context) interactions.
Curators manually annotated 2,432 PubMed abstracts for five different compound protein interactions (agonist, antagonist, inhibitor, activator and substrate/product production). 
For this task performance was reported in terms of F1 score and the best team achieved a score of 64.10%.
