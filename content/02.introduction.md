# Introduction
Populating knowledge bases is a daunting and arduous task that takes a lot of manual effort to accomplish.
Typically, this task involves a lot of manual curation, where curators read and parse newly published paper to extract implied relationships. 
This framework becomes infeasible as the rate of publications continues to increase exponentially [@doi:10.1002/asi.23329].
A solution towards this problem is to undergo relationship extraction.  
Relation extraction is the process of creating a machine learning system  to automatically scan and extract information from papers.
Creating these machine learning system involves the arduous process of generate training examples.
A common technique to ease this process is to use distant supervision [@doi:10.3115/1690219.1690287], which assumes that if two entities are present in a databases, then all sentences that contain that pair will assert the relationship in some way.
This technique is useful for quickly generating training samples; however, it generates a lot of noise.
Recently, there has been work that builds off of this idea called, data programming paradigm [@arxiv:1605.07723].
This paradigm generates large annotated datasets quickly by using weak supervision strategies in the form of label functions. 
Despite the usefulness of this paradigm, creating a useful label functions can take a significant amount of time.  
In this paper, we aim to accelerate the process of generating label functions using the data programming paradigm. 
The question we are answering is: can we accelerate the label function generation process by reusing label functions across different relationship types.
