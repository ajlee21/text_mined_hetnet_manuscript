## Recent Work
Realtionship extraction is the process of detecting and classifiying semantic relationships from a set of documents.
This process of can be broken down into three categories: (1) unsupervised machine learning via co-occurence scores or clustering approaches, (2) pure natural language processing approaches using hand crafted text pattern rules for manual extraction, and (3) supervised or semi-supervised machine learning using annotated datasets to classify documents or sentences.
In this section we will discuss previous work that has been done one an individual relationship level as well as on a multiple relationship scale.

### Disease-Gene Associations 
Regarding disease-gene associations, previous work has used a co-occurence score to identify novel relationships [@doi:10.1016/j.ymeth.2014.11.020 (Diseases Paper)].
Another approach used a co-occurence score to construct a disease-gene network to find associations [@doi:10.1016/j.jbi.2015.01.003].
Besides these basic co-occurence methods, previous work incorporated term weights to improve classification performance [@doi:10.1186/s12859-018-2048-y].
These approaches are useful for not relying on using annotated data and have powerful recall performance; however, these methods lack in precision performance.  
In pure natural language process space prevous work has used a dictionary lookup approach [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkv383 (Polysearch)] to perform extraction. 
In conjunction with a dictionary look up another work used hand crafted rules to perform extraction [@doi:10.1016/j.jbi.2015.08.008 (PKDE4J)].
Despite the great performance, this approach takes siginificant amount of manual effort to use.  
Using supervised machine learning techniques significant amount of algorithms used a support vector machine to perform extraction [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btw503 (DTMiner)].
Another work used tree-kernels to identify and extract disease gene associations [@doi:10.1186/s12859-015-0472-9 (BeFree)]. 
Recently there has been work done that uses an ensemble of svm classifiers to extract relationships [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0200699 (ensemble svm)].
There has also been work done using a maximum entropy classifier to extract disease gene associations [@doi:10.3115/v1/W14-1108].
Majority of these algorithms use hand crafted datasets to evaluate their method.  

### Compound Treats Disease
In respect to compound treats disease (CtD) relationship extraction, recent work has involved using co-occurence [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000943 (CoPub Discovery)].
Used swanson's abc model to make drug repurposing predictions [@doi:10.1109/BIBM.2015.7359766 (ABC drug text)].
Another work extracted compound treats disease predictions using a side effect text mining system [@doi:10.7717/peerj-cs.46].

### Compound Binds Gene
For compound binds to gene (CbG) there has been work on combining machine learning with predefined rules and pattern matching to extract information [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkx462 (Limtox)].
With the creation of the biocreative VI challenge, there has been multiple work that focused on extracting compound protein interactions [@raw:biocreative/chemprot].
One work consisted of using a linguistic pattern aware dependency tree kernel to do extraction [@doi:10.1093/database/bay108 (LPTK)].
There was a tree lstm network that was generated to extract compound protein interactions [@doi:10.1093/database/bay060 (C-G realtion extract neual network)].
There was an ensemble method using svm and a whole bunch of deep learning methods [@doi:10.1093/database/bay073].
Another awesome thing is that there was an autoencoder used with full text in a semi-supervised way [@arxiv:1901.06103].
deep learning  with neural attention models [@doi:10.1093/database/bay102]

### Gene Gene Interactions
For gene interacts with gene (GiG) relationships, also considered protein protein interactions, there has been a lot of work on the subject.
There was an open task that invovled seeing if uses can develop the best model to extract protein protein interactions [@doi:10.1186/gb-2008-9-s2-s4 (Biocreative II)].
The best performing model was a support vector machine classifier.
Another method that extracted this information used a Bi-LSTM model [@doi:10.1016/j.knosys.2018.11.020 (Feature Assisted)].
Interesting people used a svm classifer to extract protein protein interactions [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004630].
[@doi:10.1186/s12859-019-2634-7 (co-occurnece gene-interaction network]

### Multiple Relationship Extraction
Depsite the relationship specific methods, recent work has shifted towards extract multiple relationships at once. 
One approach took a bi-clustering of dependency trees paths using Medline abstracts to extract multiple relationships [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty114].
Another method used an updated co-occurence score approach to effectively extract information [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btz490 (CoCoScore)].
another approach pepople have used to extract realtionships is to use crowd sourcing, which involves using people to construct your dataset [@doi:10.1101/564187].
