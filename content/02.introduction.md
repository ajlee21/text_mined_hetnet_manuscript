# Introduction

Populating knowledge bases often requires highly-trained scientists to read biomedical literature and summarize the results.
This manual curation process requires a significant amount of time and effort.
The rate of publications is increasing exponentially [@doi:10.1002/asi.23329], but the number of curators is not.
We expect this will lead to gaps in knowledge bases.

Relationship extraction is the process of creating a machine learning system to automatically scan and extract relationships from textual sources.
Machine learning methods often require a large corpus of well-labeled training data to succeed, which still requires manual curation.
Distant supervision is one technique to sidestep the requirement of well-annotated sentences: with distant supervision one makes the assumption that that all sentences containing an entity pair found in a selected database provide evidence for a relationship [@doi:10.3115/1690219.1690287].
Distant supervision provides many labeled examples; however it is accompanied by a decrease in the quality of the labels.  
Ratner et al. [@arxiv:1605.07723] recently introduced "data programming" as a solution.
Data programming combines distant supervision with the automated labeling of text using hand-written label functions.
The distant supervision sources and label functions are integrated using a noise aware generative model, which is used to produce training labels.
Combining distant supervision with label functions can dramatically reduce the time required to acquire sufficient training data.
However, constructing a knowledge base of heterogeneous relationships through this framework still requires tens of hand-written label functions for each relationship type.
Writing useful label functions requires significant error analysis, and can be time-consuming.

In this paper, we aim to address the question: to what extent can we re-use label functions across different relationship types?
(a brief 1-2 sentence blurb about why this is plausible)
Label function re-use could dramatically reduce the number of label functions required to generate a heterogeneous knowledge graph, which would save substantial researcher time.
