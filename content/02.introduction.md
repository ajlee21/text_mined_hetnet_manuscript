## Recent Work
Relationship extraction is the process of detecting and classifiying semantic relationships from a set of documents.
This process of can be broken down into three categories: (1) unsupervised machine learning via co-occurence scores or clustering approaches, (2) natural language processing approaches using hand crafted text pattern rules for manual extraction, and (3) supervised or semi-supervised machine learning using annotated datasets to classify documents or sentences.
We discuss previous work done for each relationship used in this project.

### Disease-Gene Associations 
Regarding disease-gene associations, previous work has used a co-occurence score to identify novel relationships [@doi:10.1016/j.ymeth.2014.11.020 (Diseases Paper)].
Another approach used a co-occurence score to construct a disease-gene network to find associations [@doi:10.1016/j.jbi.2015.01.003].
Besides these basic co-occurence methods, previous work incorporated term weights to improve classification performance [@doi:10.1186/s12859-018-2048-y].
These approaches are useful for not relying on using annotated data and have powerful recall performance; however, these methods lack in precision performance.  
In pure natural language process space prevous work has used a dictionary lookup approach [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkv383 (Polysearch)] to perform extraction. 
In conjunction with a dictionary look up another work used hand crafted rules to perform extraction [@doi:10.1016/j.jbi.2015.08.008 (PKDE4J)].
Despite the great performance, this approach takes siginificant amount of manual effort to use.  
Using supervised machine learning techniques significant amount of algorithms used a support vector machine to perform extraction [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btw503 (DTMiner)].
Another work used tree-kernels to identify and extract disease gene associations [@doi:10.1186/s12859-015-0472-9 (BeFree)]. 
Recently there has been work done that uses an ensemble of svm classifiers to extract relationships [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0200699 (ensemble svm)].
There has also been work done using a maximum entropy classifier to extract disease gene associations [@doi:10.3115/v1/W14-1108].
Majority of these algorithms use hand crafted datasets to evaluate their method.

### Compound Treats Disease
In respect to compound treats disease (CtD) relationship extraction, recent work has involved using co-occurence [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000943 (CoPub Discovery)].
Used swanson's abc model to make drug repurposing predictions [@doi:10.1109/BIBM.2015.7359766 (ABC drug text)].
Another work extracted compound treats disease predictions using a side effect text mining system [@doi:10.7717/peerj-cs.46].

[@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty114 (Bethany's work)]
Majority of work has been focused on compound inducing disease, because of the biocreative task [@doi:10.1093/database/baw032 (Biocreative V)]. 

### Compound Binds Gene
For compound binds to gene (CbG) there has been work on combining machine learning with predefined rules and pattern matching to extract information [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkx462 (Limtox)].
With the creation of the biocreative VI challenge, there has been multiple work that focused on extracting compound protein interactions [@raw:biocreative/chemprot (open supervised learning with this)].
One work consisted of using a linguistic pattern aware dependency tree kernel to do extraction [@doi:10.1093/database/bay108 (LPTK)].
There was a tree lstm network that was generated to extract compound protein interactions [@doi:10.1093/database/bay060 (C-G realtion extract neual network)].
There was an ensemble method using svm and a whole bunch of deep learning methods [@doi:10.1093/database/bay073].
Another awesome thing is that there was an autoencoder used with full text in a semi-supervised way [@arxiv:1901.06103].

### Gene Gene Interactions
For gene interacts with gene (GiG) relationships, also considered protein protein interactions, there has been a lot of work on the subject.
The best performing model was a support vector machine classifier.
Another method that extracted this information used a Bi-LSTM model [@doi:10.1016/j.knosys.2018.11.020 (Feature Assisted)].
Interesting people used a svm classifer to extract protein protein interactions [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004630].
There was an open task that invovled seeing if uses can develop the best model to extract protein protein interactions [@doi:10.1186/gb-2008-9-s2-s4 (Biocreative II open supervised section here)].
